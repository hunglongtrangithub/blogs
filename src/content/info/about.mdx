# About me

I'm Hung Tran, currently a Computer Science senior undergraduate at the University of South Florida, interested in building performant systems for serving deep learning models. Some facts about me:

1. I've had more than 2 years of experience as NLP research trainee at [LAILab](https://lab.moffitt.org/thieu/), fine-tuning clinical LLMs on Nvidia DGX Servers and serving them in production at Moffitt Cancer Center. After that I was a Software Development Engineer intern at Amazon, working under the RBKS AI org.

2. I like to write good quality code, whether it is for research or production.

3. Currently I'm focused on learning about systems - operating system, database, and distributed system.
   I'm contributing to [MuopDB](https://github.com/hicder/muopdb), a Rust vector database, through which I learn about system programming and OS fundamentals.

4. I believe that software should empower users, not make them enslaved by it.

This blog is where I save my notes and thoughts in my projects and my learning journey. I hope you can find something useful here.
